# DetectionRules

Some of the detection rules for my public research. Feel free to contact me if you have an interesting sample, topic or you have a question about the rules.

## Note
In addition to the rules, there are some scripts (mostly in Python) that I developed in the analysis process. 

## Samples

All samples collected by my honeypots. They are all password-protected archive files with password `infected`.

## Categories
